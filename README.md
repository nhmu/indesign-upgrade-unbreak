Fix DF015 errors when using RemoteUpdateManager on InDesign &amp; InCopy

This tool fixes missing symlinks left behind by the InDesign and InCopy installers
on macOS. This corrects DF015 errors when installing updates with
RemoteUpdateManager.

## Problem details

Some of the plugins are installed with directories instead of symlinks in their
`Versions` directories and with a directory instead of a symlink at `Resources`.
The `Versions` directory should contain a directory called `A` and a symlink to it
called `Current`, but on broken installations `Current` is a directory.
`Resources` should be a symlink to `Versions/Current/Resources`, but on broken
installations it's also a directory.

Replacing these directories with symlinks makes updates work, but updates
sometimes re-break it, so it's important to run this tool before every
RemoteUpdateManager run.

We opened a case with Adobe after we hit this with CC2014, but as of CC2015 it
has not been fixed. CC2017 does not appear to suffer from this problem.
